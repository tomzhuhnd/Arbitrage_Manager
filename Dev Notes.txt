# ================================================== TO DO's ================================================== # 


# GUI - Front End

    Add failover handlers:

[ ] - Error handler - for when too many requests are being made

# Connectivity - BFX
[ ] - Fix formatting issues with the Thread

# Program Manager
[ ] - Add a smarter program stop function so that it continuously loops, and then force closes the threads if they hang
[ ] - We should have a global event that allows all of the threads to get into the main loop, so that a main thread doesn't automatically start executing functions before a dependency in another thread is fully initialized
